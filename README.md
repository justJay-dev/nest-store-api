## Description

Built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

This is a good faith effort to rebuild the existing functionality from [link-to-the-store-api-here](http://todo.do) without any extra dependences for running locally, and using relational data instead of nosql.

data is stored in a local sqlitedb, all of the entities should also work in postgres if you were so inclined.

Swagger can be found at the `/docs` route when running the application
